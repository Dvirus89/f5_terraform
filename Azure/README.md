# Deploying F5 in Azure with Terraform
The Azure folder contains various deployments. All deployments utilize the F5 Automation Toolchain components for Declarative Onboarding (DO for L1-L3) and Application Services (AS3 for L4-L7) in order to asist in onboarding the BIG-IP and configuration. All deployments launch a 2-NIC BIG-IP cluster in Active/standby.

  - **[Standalone](Standalone)** (updated May 2020) <br> This Terraform plan uses the Azurerm provider to build the necessary Azure objects and a standalone BIG-IP device with 2-NICs. Traffic flows from client to F5 to backend app servers.
  - **[Autoscale via LB](Autoscale_via_lb)** (updated June 2020) <br> This Terraform plan deploys BIG-IP devices in an Azure VM Scale Set. Each device is standalone, each device retreives its onboarding from custom-data, and each device is treated as immutable. Network/Application changes are made to Terraform TF files (or DO and AS3 json files), and the Azure VMSS will perform rolling upgrades of each BIG-IP as a result of modified custom-data.
  - **[HA via API](HA_via_api)** (updated May 2020) <br> This Terraform plan uses the Azurerm provider to build the necessary Azure objects and a pair of BIG-IP devices with 2-NICs. The Azure REST API is used to move cloud objects (ex. IPs, routes) during failover when the BIG-IP detects a problem with its peer. Traffic flows from client to F5 to backend app servers.
  - **[HA via LB](HA_via_lb)** (updated May 2020) <br> This Terraform plan uses the Azurerm provider to build the necessary Azure objects and a pair of BIG-IP devices. The Azure LB is used to distribute traffic to the F5 BIG-IP devices for high availability and failover. Traffic flows from client to ALB to F5 to backend app servers.
  - **[Secure Enclave Public DMZ](Secure_Enclave_Public_DMZ)** (updated June 2020) <br> This Terraform plan uses the Azurerm provider to build the necessary Azure objects and a pair of BIG-IP devices running Web Application Firewall (WAF) and application services. This solution also integrates with Azure Sentinel. There is a "DMZ" VNET as well as an "Application" VNET. This design provides a secure cloud architecture where security services are offered in a security/parent VNET and apps are hosted in child VNETs. The Azure LB is used to distribute traffic to the F5 BIG-IP devices for high availability and failover. Traffic flows from client to ALB to F5 to backend app servers.
  - **[DMZ to On-prem](DMZ_To_On-prem)** (updated March 2019) <br> This Terraform plan uses the Azurerm provider to build the necessary Azure objects for a secure hybrid network that extends an on-premises network to Azure. The Azure LB is used to distribute traffic to the F5 BIG-IP devices for high availability and failover. Traffic flows from client to ALB to F5 to backend app servers.
