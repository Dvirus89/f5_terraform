# Deploying F5 in Google GCP with Terraform
The GCP folder contains various deployments. All deployments utilize the F5 Automation Toolchain components for Declarative Onboarding (DO for L1-L3) and Application Services (AS3 for L4-L7) in order to asist in onboarding the BIG-IP and configuration. Telemtry Streaming (TS for analytics/logging) is also installed and ready for use.

  - **[Infrastructure Only](Infrastructure-only)** (updated June 2020) <br> This Terraform plan uses the Google provider to build the basic infrastructure with VPC networks, subnets, firewall rules, routes, and storage buckets. Start here if you don't have an existing GCP network stack yet, and then move on to the other templates below.
  - **[Standalone](Standalone)** (updated June 2020) <br> This Terraform plan uses the Google provider to build the necessary Google objects and a standalone BIG-IP device with 2-NICs. Traffic flows from client to F5 to backend app servers.
  - **[HA via API](HA_via_api)** (updated June 2020) <br> This Terraform plan uses the Google provider to build the necessary Google objects and a pair of BIG-IP devices with 2-NICs. The Google REST API is used to move cloud objects (ex. IPs, routes) during failover when the BIG-IP detects a problem with its peer. Traffic flows from client to F5 to backend app servers.
  - **[HA via LB](HA_via_lb)** (updated June 2020) <br> This Terraform plan uses the Google provider to build the necessary Google objects and a pair of BIG-IP devices with 2-NICs. The Google LB is used to distribute traffic to the F5 BIG-IP devices for high availability and failover. Traffic flows from client to GLB/ILB to F5 to backend app servers.
